    <h3>
      After India gained independence in 1947, limited autonomy was conferred to
      New Delhi and was administered by a Chief Commissioner appointed by the
      Government of India. In 1966, Delhi was converted into a union territory
      and eventually the Chief Commissioner was replaced by a Lieutenant
      Governor.<br>
      The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union
      Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of
      Delhi.[29] A system was introduced under which the elected government was
      given wide powers, excluding law and order which remained with the Central
      Government.<br>
      The actual enforcement of the legislation came in 1993. The first major
      extension of New Delhi outside of Lutyens' Delhi came in the 1950s when
      the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) developed a large area of land
      southwest of Lutyens' Delhi to create the diplomatic enclave of
      Chanakyapuri, where land was allotted for embassies, chanceries, high
      commissions and residences of ambassadors, around a wide central vista.
